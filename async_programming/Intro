## Async Programming

Most applications need this:

1. Fetching data from the network.
2. Writing to a database.
3. Reading Data from file.

Your apps needs to be responsive while waiting for async operations to complete.
-> In Dart this is done with Futures, async and await.
-> Sometimes we can produce async operation that can produce more than one result at a time.
Streams: asynchronous elements delivered over time.

- often used in reactive applications. (than can update the UI when the new data is available.)

We have other future named constructors.

1. Future.delayed
2. Future.error - useful when writing tests for your asynchronous code.
3. Future.value - Use this if you want a Future that completes immediately / useful when writing tests for your asynchronous code.
4. Future.sync
5. Future.microtask
