## Error and exception Handling - Make your code roburst and improve user experience.

- Differenct kinds of errors. Some Eg:

1. Read or write files -> I/O errors.
2. Network request -> networking errors.
3. Programmer errors.

Errors vs Eception.

1. Assertions

3. try, catch finally, rethrow.

What's error?
-> Error is programmer mistake(we did something wrong).
-> Calling a function with invalid arguments, index out of bounds etc.

-> Unexpected: out of our control.
-> Handle it(eg. show message to user) and recover.
